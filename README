TEXT::TEMPLATE VERSION 0.1 alpha
27 December, 1995

COPYRIGHT

The Text::Template module is Copyright 1995 Mark-Jason Dominus.
You may use, modify, copy, and distribute it under the same terms as
Perl itself.

DESCRIPTION

This module is for filling in templates.  A template is a regular
piece of text with tiny perl programs embedded in it.  When a template
is filled in, the perl programs are evaluated, and replaced with their
values.  This is useful for generating all sorts of program output,
including HTML pages and error messages.  Templates can reside in
files external to the program that is filling them in, and they can be
modified and maintained by persons unfamiliar with perl, because the
perl parts of a template are encapsulated.

PREREQUISITES

None.

HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

No `test's yet; sorry.

RECENT CHANGES

This is the first general release.

This is an ALPHA release.  Future changes are very likely.  Future
incompatible changes are likely.

TODO

This package should fill in templates in a `Safe' compartment.

The callback function that `fill_in' calls when a template contains an
error should be eble to return an error message to the rest of the
program.

`my' variables in `fill_in' are still susceptible to being clobbered
by template evaluation.  Perhaps it will be safer to make them `local'
variables.

Perhaps there should be a utility method for emptying out a package.
